#OfficeHours

OfficeHours is a tool to built to facilitate collaboration and learning on university and college campuses, and in companies and organizations of all sizes.

##How it Works

OfficeHours provides a live feed of the active office hours within your organization, letting you know who is available where, and for how much longer. It features robust search functionality, powered by ElasticSearch, which allows you to search by names, departments, and buildings.
